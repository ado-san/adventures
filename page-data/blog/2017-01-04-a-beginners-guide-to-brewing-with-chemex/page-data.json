The goal of the social network is to send unused laptops, ebook readers, tablet-PCs and any device that can be loaded with educational software to needy schools around the world using collaboration and without incurring any economic nor environmental costs.","tags":["donation","education","labdoo","edubuntu","humanitarian","socialnetwork","charity"]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"ed0252c5-5a2f-50b8-856b-c27949a8cc72"}}}
